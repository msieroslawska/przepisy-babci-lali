## 🚀 TODO

- [ ] Finish adding all recipes
- [x] Normalize recipe names for the file mapper to pick up all the pics
  - [ ] ~Think about another data structure to keep the recipes... JSON is too simple.~ JSON is fine if structured well. Will stay for now.
- [ ] Make the recipe layout more versatile to be able to display more blocks
- [ ] Somewhat... 🤷‍♀️ improve the styling -> **in progress**
  - [ ] Mobile layout
- [ ] Better image scaling (now they're too big!)
- [ ] Better graphQL query for looking up the images (right now it's a list, should be just one item instead)

## 💡 Ideas

- [ ] Add translations
  - [ ] Make them look fancy
- [ ] Take better pictures
- [ ] Random recipe preview on the main page
